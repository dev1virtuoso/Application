It is usually used internally by the software developers. This version may have more errors and defects that need further refinement.\n\n- Testing Version (Beta): Compared to the Alpha version, the Beta version has significant improvements and resolves major errors. However, it may still have some defects that require testing and feedback for further improvement.\n\n- Release Candidate (RC) Version: The RC version is an important stage following the Beta version, indicating that the software has entered the final testing phase and may become a candidate for the official release. At this stage, the software usually eliminates most known errors and defects and meets the expected functionality and quality requirements.\n\n- Stable Version: This version indicates that the software has become relatively stable, with most errors and defects fixed. However, there may still be a few minor issues present.\n\n- Release Version: This version represents the final release, having undergone comprehensive testing and verification, and is ready for normal user use.",
