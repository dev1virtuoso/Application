# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting me through [following methods](https://github.com/dev1virtuoso/Documentation/blob/main/dev1virtuoso/Attachment/dev1virtuoso/carson-wu.md#Contact). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Project maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
